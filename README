# Privacy International VM mirror

As explained [here](https://github.com/privacyint/appdata-environment-desktop/issues/14), the current downloading path for this VM is down. 
Luckily I had a version on an old laptop. 

Here it is (release tab).

No infringement intended, If privacyInt want to reach out, I'll take this repo down
